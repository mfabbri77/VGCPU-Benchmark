# Appendix F — Licensing, Copyright, and IP Policy

## Purpose

This appendix defines the licensing and intellectual property (IP) policy for the benchmark suite, including rules for incorporating third-party dependencies, distributing binary releases, attributing licenses, and handling benchmark assets (scenes/IR). It is designed to reduce legal risk and ensure users can understand redistribution constraints.

## F.1 Project License and Ownership

1. The project **MUST** choose a primary open-source license for project-owned code and assets (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, or similar).
2. The chosen license **MUST** be stated in:

   * a root `LICENSE` file,
   * the README,
   * release notes for binary distributions.
3. The project **MUST** clearly distinguish:

   * project-owned code (under the project license),
   * third-party dependencies (under their respective licenses),
   * generated artifacts (results, reports) produced by the tool (user-owned unless otherwise stated).

## F.2 Third-Party Dependencies Policy

### F.2.1 Dependency Inventory

1. The project **MUST** maintain an inventory of third-party dependencies, including:

   * name,
   * version/commit hash,
   * license identifier,
   * source URL or provenance reference,
   * whether the dependency is redistributed in binaries.
2. This inventory **MUST** be updated when dependencies change.

### F.2.2 Compatibility and Redistribution

1. Before including a backend library or dependency in binary releases, maintainers **MUST** verify:

   * the license permits redistribution in binary form,
   * attribution and notice obligations,
   * any restrictions affecting static vs dynamic linking.
2. If a license obligation is unclear, the default **SHOULD** be:

   * include the adapter support in source builds, but
   * exclude the backend from binary releases until clarified,
   * document the decision in release notes.

### F.2.3 Vendoring and Fetching

1. If dependencies are vendored or fetched during build, the project **MUST**:

   * preserve license notices,
   * record versions/commits in the dependency pin record and license inventory.
2. The project **MUST NOT** remove or obscure license headers and notices from third-party code.

## F.3 Binary Release Compliance Requirements

1. Each binary release artifact **MUST** include a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` file (or equivalent) containing:

   * a list of redistributed third-party components,
   * their licenses,
   * required attribution notices.
2. Binary releases **MUST** include (or reference) copies of licenses required by redistributed components.
3. Release notes **MUST** declare which backends are included in each artifact and which are excluded due to:

   * platform constraints,
   * build constraints,
   * licensing constraints.

## F.4 Linking Policy (Static vs Dynamic)

1. The project **MUST** document, per backend, whether it is linked:

   * statically,
   * dynamically, or
   * loaded via OS mechanisms.
2. When a backend’s license imposes conditions based on linking mode, the build system **MUST** support a compliant linking strategy for release builds.
3. If compliance cannot be ensured for a backend in binary releases, that backend **MUST** be excluded from binary releases and supported via source builds only (documented).

## F.5 Benchmark Assets and Scenes IP

1. Scene IR assets and manifests authored by the project **MUST** be licensed under the project license unless explicitly stated otherwise.
2. Scenes **MUST NOT** include:

   * raster images,
   * fonts,
   * or other assets with unclear redistribution rights,
     consistent with project scope and to reduce licensing risk.
3. If any external reference materials are used to design scenes (e.g., inspiration), the project **SHOULD** document that scenes are original works and do not embed copyrighted content.

## F.6 Contributor License Policy (Recommended)

1. The project **SHOULD** define contribution terms (e.g., Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)).
2. If a CLA is not used, the project **SHOULD** require contributors to certify they have rights to submit the code and that contributions are licensed under the project license.
3. Contribution policy **MUST** be documented in `CONTRIBUTING`.

## F.7 Generated Outputs and Result Ownership

1. Benchmark outputs (JSON/CSV/reports) generated by running the tool **SHOULD** be owned by the user who ran the tool.
2. The project **MUST** not claim ownership over user-generated benchmark results.
3. Documentation **SHOULD** state that publishing results may include machine/environment metadata, and users should review privacy settings (Chapter 9).

## F.8 Enforcement and Review Checklist

For any change that adds or updates a dependency/backend, maintainers **SHOULD** perform a checklist review:

1. License identified and recorded in dependency inventory.
2. Redistribution rights confirmed for binary releases (if applicable).
3. Notices and license texts included in release artifact packaging.
4. Linking mode documented and compliant.
5. Release notes updated for adapter inclusion/exclusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The appendix defines a clear policy for project licensing, third-party dependency inventory, and binary release compliance.
2. It specifies required license notices and declarations in release artifacts and release notes.
3. It defines a conservative default for uncertain licensing (exclude from binaries; document).
4. It addresses scene asset IP policy consistent with “no external raster/fonts” scope.
5. It includes contributor terms guidance and generated output ownership.

## Dependencies

1. Chapter 11 — Deployment Architecture (binary release composition and adapter inclusion policy).
2. Chapter 9 — Security, Privacy, and Compliance (supply-chain provenance, metadata considerations).
3. Chapter 14 — Documentation & Communication Plan (required docs and release notes structure).
